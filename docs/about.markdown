I am a PhD Candidate in Transportation Systems Analysis and Planning at Northwestern University. In the [*Mobility and Behavior Lab*](https://www.amandastathopoulos.com/), I study how people change their travel behavior and preferences, especially in response to policy interventions like transit safety measures. You can see more in the [Projects](/projects.md) tab.

When I am not doing research, I like to play soccer, take photos, [listen to music](https://www.last.fm/user/aesch_spencer), and organize for better working conditions with my union, [*NUGW-UE*](https://nugradworkers.org/).
